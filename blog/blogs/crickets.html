your head hits the pillow that's when you hear it:

Is it over?...........CHIIIIIIIRRRRRRp. Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!</p>
<p>I hate them. Ever had a basement bedroom? Those suckers will get in there.
You'll know too. You'll know because there is no way of not knowing.
CHIIIIIRRRRRPPPP!! You may be thinking, but what if I'm deaf and can't hear the chirping?
Well, there will come a time that you will step out of bed and you'll feel one.
Right there underneath your foot.</p>
